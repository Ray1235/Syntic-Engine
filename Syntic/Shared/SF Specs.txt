*.sf specs

*.sf file contains multiple files compressed with zlib

There is no information stored except for compressed and uncompressed size of the files
The rest of the info is in the *.sft file

typedef struct {
	unsigned long compressedSize;
	unsigned long uncompressedSize; // a single file can be max 4GB... too much? lol
	unsigned char *compressedFile;
} sfFile_s;

*.sft file contains information for each file with offsets, etc.

typedef struct {
	char magic[6];     // SynSFT
	unsigned char version;
	unsigned short fileCount;
} sftHeader_s;

typedef struct {
	char name[256];
	unsigned char type;	// the type of the file, used to optimize asset workflow.
	unsigned long offset;
} sftFileEntry_s;

typedef struct {
	sftHeader_s header;
	sftFileEntry_s *entries;
} sft_s;
